<p>In HTML, images are defined with the ^img^ tag.
The ^img^ tag is empty, it contains attributes only,
and does not have a closing tag.
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image.</p>
<p>If a browser cannot find an image,
 it will display the value of the alt attribute:
 <img src="programming.gif"></p>
